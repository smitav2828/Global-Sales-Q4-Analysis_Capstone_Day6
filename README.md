## 📊 Q4 Crisis Meeting – Global Sales Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world executive crisis meeting where company leadership must quickly understand why sales are declining in Q4.

The CEO, CFO, and VP of Sales need a clear, interactive dashboard that answers three critical questions:

* Where are we losing money?
* Which product is failing?
  Is this decline seasonal or structural?

The solution is an **Excel Pivot Dashboard** built for fast decision-making.

## 🧠 Business Scenario

Context:
Sales performance has dropped significantly. Leadership has only **45 minutes** before an emergency meeting and needs insights immediately.

The dashboard is designed to:

* Identify weak regions and countries
* Pinpoint low-margin products
* Analyze profit trends over time
* Compare Online vs Offline sales performance

## 📊 Dashboard Visuals
